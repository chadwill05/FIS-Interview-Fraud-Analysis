# FIS-Interview-Fraud-Analysis

I recently compleleted FIS' Card Fraud Analytics - Analyst Excel Comprehension.

I have decided to take this a step further and add further analysis and go deeper into the dataset. 

In this repository you will see a cleaned up Card Fraud Dataset. All this data was uploaded to a Postgresql Database to be and uploaded to Jupyter Notebook for further SQL and Python Analysis. 

**Cons with this dataset: There was no Date Timestamp** 

After EDA and further analysis, this data was displayed further with Tableau. (INSERT LINK HERE)

**5 QUESTIONS I wanted to look further into**
1. **Identify High-Risk Transactions**: What are the top 10 transactions with the highest fraud scores, and what characteristics do they share?
2. **Fraud Score Distribution and Outliers**: What is the distribution of fraud scores across the dataset?
3. **Merchant Category Analysis**: How do transaction amounts and fraud scores vary across different merchant categories (SIC Codes)?
4. **Geographical Analysis**: Which countries or states have the highest average fraud scores?
5. **Correlation Between Fraud Scores and Transaction Amounts**: Is there a correlation between transaction amounts and fraud scores?
6. **Point of Sale Entry Mode Analysis**: How do fraud scores differ by POS entry mode?
